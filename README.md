# Fancy Sort Algos

Just a React app visualizing different sort algorithms.

## Story Time

Back in 2014, a fellow student and I were both math pre-course tutors for the winter term at Technical 
University of 
Munich (TUM). During that time, we were joking about how stupid Bogosort is. That gave me the idea to visualize this 
extraordinary sorting algorithm in a web application along with a few others. However, I lost the code after resetting
 my computer.

This is why I came up with the re-implementation you are looking at right now using some more modern 
 technology. Enjoy!

## Algorithms

So far, the following algorithms are visualized:

- Merge sort
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Bogosort
